# employment  of ultrasonicmic sensors the enhancement of military government

The main aim of the project is :-
This is an one of a kind strategy to detect individuals who are caught in snow utilizing ultrasonic and infrared radiations.
We have built up this undertaking the view of  Internet Of Things (IOT).
This venture decreases an individualâ€™s inaccuracy involved in rescue missions.

The main objective of the project is:-

To lessen the efforts taken by rescuers to save the victims lives.
To guarantee the reduction of loss of human lives.
To develop productivity with the contrast of loss of human life.

The techniques that are used till date are:
			
1.Avalanche transceivers:-It is conveyed by each mountain dweller which transmits 457Khz,with the assistance of that recurrence they find the area of the individual.  Also referred to as beacons.

2.RECCO rescue system:-This framework makes the mountain climbers to convey a chip with them and discover the individual who is stuck in the snow.
			
3.Dogs:- As dogs have incredible detecting capacities they discover the individual with help of the scent of individual who is trapped.

4.Probes and shovels are instruments used by the rescuer.

Problems faced in existing systems:-

Time consuming.
Limited range.
Malfunctioning of instruments.
Risk of life.
Managing interference.
Exact location may not found.
Condition may worsen.

Need for the proposa of new advanced system:-

To reduce the time to save the affected victim.
To reduce the risk for the rescuer.
To prevent worsening of the situation.
To reduce fatalities.
To increase the probability of rescue.

sensors and modules used:-

Ultra Sonic sensor
PIR sensor(infra red)
Arduino uno board (microcontroller)
Servo motor (180 degree)
12v battery
9v battery
pulley
led's
Connecting wires

Function of the new advanced system

Fundamental function of the product is to recognize the presence of human life using body heat and movements. it will be used for military purpose. it sends the information to the headquaters and it will be easier for the rescue team to reach the affected soldiers.
